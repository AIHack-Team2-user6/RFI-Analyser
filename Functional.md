To create a score for all submissions, you would typically use predefined criteria to evaluate each entry systematically. Below is an example approach you can follow to score submissions:

---

### **Scoring Criteria**
1. **Relevance (1-10 points)**  
   - Does the submission effectively address the topic?  
   - Is the content aligned with the given guidelines?
   
2. **Creativity (1-10 points)**  
   - Is the submission original and innovative?  
   - Does it showcase unique ideas or perspectives?

3. **Quality of Content (1-10 points)**  
   - Is the submission well-written, clear, and free of errors?  
   - Is the information well-organized and easy to understand?

4. **Engagement (1-10 points)**  
   - Does the submission capture the reader's interest?  
   - Does it evoke emotion, insight, or curiosity?

5. **Technical Accuracy (1-10 points)**

### **How to Apply the Scoring System**
1. **Set up a scoring sheet:**  
   Create a table where you list all submissions and the scores for each criterion.

2. **Evaluate systematically:**  
   Score each submission based on the 6 criteria outlined.

3. **Rank submissions:**  
   Calculate the total scores, and rank submissions from highest to lowest.
