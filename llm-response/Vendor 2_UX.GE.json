  "justification": "Vendor 2 states support for 'immersive visualization of Digital Twins using Unity, Unreal Engine,' and enables 'training, walkthroughs, and system interaction via game-like experiences,' directly referencing 'immersive virtual worlds' and 'interactive experiences.' Integration with gaming engines and 3D standards is evidenced. However, there are no concrete examples of 'highly interactive' user-driven actions beyond general statements about system interaction. Specifics on the level or type of user interactivity within the metaverse are lacking, preventing a perfect score.",
