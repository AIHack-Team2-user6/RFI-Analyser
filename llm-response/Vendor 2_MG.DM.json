  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 demonstrates a 'comprehensive IoT device management solution' supporting 'secure device onboarding, configuration, firmware updates, diagnostics, and remote monitoring.' Device management is enabled via standard protocols (OPC UA, MQTT, AMQP, HTTPS) and complies with IEC 62443, GDPR, and ISO/IEC 27001, indicating strong security. Explicit mention of provisioning, authenticating, maintaining, monitoring, and diagnosing devices in a Digital Twin context further supports completeness. However, some implementation specifics (e.g., granular process flow) are not detailed, preventing a perfect score."
