  "score": 8,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 states it 'facilitates API-first architecture' and enables systems 'to publish RESTful and GraphQL APIs for both internal and external consumers,' directly supporting the requirement. The explicit mention of 'OpenAPI-compliant interfaces' and 'integration with third-party applications and partner ecosystems' strengthens this. However, while the approach is described as simplifying integration, there is a lack of detail on how complexity is abstracted for developers or specific support for developer experience, preventing a perfect score.",
  "ability": "The ability for the digital twin to publish APIs to external, partner, and internal developers to access data and services.",
