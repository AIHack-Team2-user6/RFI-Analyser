  "justification": "Vendor 2 explicitly states API-first architecture ('enabling Digital Twin systems to publish RESTful and GraphQL APIs for both internal and external consumers') and supports integration ('simplifies integration with third-party applications and partner ecosystems'). OpenAPI-compliant interfaces, OData, OAuth 2.0, SAML, and security standards are detailed, directly aligning with the requirement. However, while strong, the response does not expound on ease of use for developers unfamiliar with product internals, so is not absolutely perfect.",
