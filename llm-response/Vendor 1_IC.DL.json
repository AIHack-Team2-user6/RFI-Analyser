  "justification": "The Offering describes a 'managed and decentralized ledger... ensuring data integrity and tamper-proof storage' which addresses requirements for immutability and trustworthy automation. Interfaces support REST APIs and mention secure enclaves, aligning with security needs. However, explicit support for 'digital twin applications' and 'smart contracts' is not clearly stated. The response is strong on ledger immutability and integration but lacks direct evidence of digital twin and smart contract functionality.",
  "ability": "The ability to use distributed ledgers for digital twin applications that require immutable data for digital twin instances, transactions and automation (smart contracts)",
