  "score": 7,
  "justification": "The offering describes a 'managed and decentralized ledger' with 'blockchain' ensuring 'data integrity and tamper-proof storage,' closely matching the requirement for immutable data and full transaction records. It also references REST APIs and secure enclaves for secure integration. However, there is no mention of specific support for digital twin applications or smart contracts functionality, which prevents a full score.",
  "ability": "The ability to use distributed ledgers for digital twin applications that require immutable data for digital twin instances, transactions and automation (smart contracts)",
