  "score": 8,
  "justification": "The vendor clearly states that all three offerings – Event Grid, Cloud 1 Service Bus, and IoT Central – enable 'seamless integration with control systems, IoT devices/sensors, and SCADA' and facilitate interoperability between OT and IoT applications and Digital Twin systems. Explicit reference to built-in connectivity and management features strengthens the claim. However, there is some repetition and a lack of concrete technical detail (e.g., specific protocols or APIs), which leaves a slight gap and prevents a perfect score.",
