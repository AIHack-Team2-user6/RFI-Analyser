  "justification": "The vendor explicitly describes offerings ('facilitates seamless integration', 'enables robust integration', 'provides a comprehensive platform') that support real-time, reliable data flow between OT, IoT, Digital Twin systems, and SCADA. Compliance with NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 and FedRAMP is specified for interfaces. However, details on direct integration capabilities (e.g., protocols, device compatibility) are high-level, and the response lacks explicit technical depth or concrete integration examples.",
