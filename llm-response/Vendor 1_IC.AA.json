  "justification": "The offerings explicitly mention unified analytics platforms, advanced analytics, operational analysis, and delivering comprehensive insights, all of which support data study and presentation. Interfaces list REST APIs, SQL, and visualization SDKs supporting required data manipulation and analytics. However, while features like 'charts, tables, dashboards' and filtering are implied by analytics platforms, direct mention of these functions (especially dashboards or specific filtering methods) is missing, preventing a perfect score.",

The ability to analyze data through charts, tables, dashboards, fetch data between dates, and filter data based on various criteria. The analysis of data, typically large sets of business data, using mathematics, statistics, and computer software with an objective to draw conclusions.",
