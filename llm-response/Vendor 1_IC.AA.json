  "score": 9,
  "justification": "The solution details robust analytics offerings ('unified analytics platform,' 'data engineering, data science, and business intelligence,' 'advanced analytics'), multiple standards-based interfaces (including REST APIs, SQL, Spark), and strong analytic capabilities ('analyze data through charts, tables, dashboards, fetch data between dates, and filter data based on various criteria'). The response is clear and addresses nearly all expected analytic and integration needs, but does not provide explicit evidence of customization or extensibility options, slightly reducing a perfect score."
