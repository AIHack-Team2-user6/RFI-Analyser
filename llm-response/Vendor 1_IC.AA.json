  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 1's offerings explicitly support analytics (e.g., 'unified analytics platform', 'advanced analytics and machine learning', 'ad hoc data exploration', 'operational analysis'), and the interfaces (REST APIs, SQL, GraphQL, T-SQL, SDKs) enable filtering, fetching, and visualizing data. They mention functionality to draw conclusions from data and analyze trends. However, there is no explicit, direct mention of chart/table/dashboard visualizations, only implied through capabilities like 'comprehensive insights' and 'ad hoc data exploration.' This slight lack of specificity prevents a perfect score.",
  "ability": "The study and presentation of data to create information and knowledge. The ability to analyze data through charts, tables, dashboards, fetch data between dates, and filter data based on various criteria. The analysis of data, typically large sets of business data, using mathematics, statistics, and computer software with an objective to draw conclusions.",
