  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 provides detailed measures: 'simulation, validation, and real-time analytics,' use of 'Simcenter Safety Analysis, MindSphere Health Monitoring, and SIPLUS extreme hardware,' and modeling of hazardous scenarios to mitigate risks. Explicit support for industry standards (IEC 61508, ISO 13849) and safety-critical development processes further strengthen the offering. The only minor gap is a lack of quantitative outcomes or metrics."
