  "justification": "Vendor 2 describes integrating safety protocols via simulation, validation, and real-time analytics, with explicit mention of mitigating scenarios like equipment failure and environmental hazards before deployment ('modeled and mitigated virtually'). They reference safety standards (IEC 61508, ISO 13849), giving evidence of compliance with best practices. However, while strong, there is no explicit statement or quantified assurance regarding 'unacceptable risk' levels, leaving a slight gap in fully meeting the requirement.",
  "ability": "The ability to operate digital twins without causing unacceptable risk of physical injury or damage to the health of people, either directly, or indirectly as a result of damage to property or to the environment",
