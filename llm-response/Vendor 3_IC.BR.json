  "justification": "Vendor 3 provides a 'flexible business rules engine...that governs how Digital Twins behave and respond' supporting creation and management of rules 'defined visually or through scripting' and triggered by various events, which directly addresses influencing behavior throughout lifecycle. Explicit support for BPMN 2.0, DMN, and REST APIs bolsters integration. While strong, it stops short of detailing management of rules over the full lifecycle or providing usage examples, hence not a perfect 10.",
