  "justification": "The vendor describes solutions (Event Grid, Service Bus, IoT Central) that 'enable seamless orchestration,' 'facilitate orchestration,' and 'support orchestration' while interfacing with multiple standards and protocols for integration. However, there is insufficient explicit mention of managing or coordinating digital twins specifically. References to 'IoT devices' and 'workflows across services' demonstrate partial but not comprehensive or fully explicit coverage of coordination among systems, applications, and (notably) digital twins.",
  "ability": "The ability to coordinate the automated configuration, management, and coordination of  systems, applications, digital twins and services.",
