  "justification": "The offering describes orchestration features—'enables seamless orchestration of event-driven workflows', 'facilitates orchestration', and 'supports orchestration by managing IoT devices'—and mentions integration with Cloud 1 services. Interfaces reference industry standards like MQTT, HTTP, AMQP, and REST. However, it only implies, not explicitly demonstrates, coordination of 'configuration, management, and coordination of ... digital twins' as required; digital twin-specific support is not clearly stated but inferred by IoT and 'automated workflows'.",
