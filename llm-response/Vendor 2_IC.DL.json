  "justification": "Vendor 2 supports tamper-proof transaction logging 'through integration with Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum-based distributed ledgers,' and includes 'smart contracts and audit trails in digital twin workflows.' Interfaces listed—REST APIs, JSON-LD, and Ethereum-compatible—are relevant and 'complies with GDPR, SOC 2, and ISO 27001.' While the offering strongly meets the requirement for immutable data and automation, there is no detail on real-world implementation or operational assurances, making the response robust yet not flawless.",
