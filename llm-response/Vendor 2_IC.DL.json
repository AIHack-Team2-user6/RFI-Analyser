  "justification": "Vendor 2 explicitly states support for 'tamper-proof transaction logging through integration with Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum-based distributed ledgers' and smart contracts, directly addressing the requirements for immutable records and automation. The mention of 'GDPR, SOC 2, and ISO 27001' compliance further supports security and integrity. However, it does not describe actual deployment scenarios or limitations, slightly reducing confidence in fully practical implementation.",
