{
  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 explicitly states 'real-time visualization of point cloud datasets, LiDAR scans, and 3D CAD models' and emphasizes 'optimized for responsiveness even when handling gigabyte-scale models' and 'multi-resolution viewports.' The claim of enabling interaction 'directly within digital twin environments' supports user-friendly interaction. However, user-friendliness is asserted but not described in detail, preventing a perfect score.",
  "ability": "The ability to render 3D visualizations from point cloud data sets generated by LiDAR and other scanning technologies",
  "category": " User Experience",
  "capability": "3D rendering"
