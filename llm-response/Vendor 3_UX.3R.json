  "justification": "Vendor 3 'provides advanced 3D rendering capabilities through Cloud 3, enabling real-time visualization of point cloud datasets, LiDAR scans, and 3D CAD models.' They also state 'responsiveness even when handling gigabyte-scale models,' supporting interaction with large datasets in a user-friendly way. Supported formats (OBJ, FBX, IFC, LAS) and multiple integration options further align with the requirement. However, the phrase 'user friendly manner' isnâ€™t addressed explicitly.",
