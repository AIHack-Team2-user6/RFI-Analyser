  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 explicitly states 'real-time visualization of point cloud datasets, LiDAR scans, and 3D CAD models,' and highlights the ability to 'interact with complex spatial data' and handle 'gigabyte-scale models.' Supported formats (OBJ, FBX, IFC, LAS) and integration options (APIs, engines) align well with the requirement. The offering directly targets user-friendly interaction and large dataset handling. There is only very minor lack of detail on specific user interface features, preventing a perfect score.",
