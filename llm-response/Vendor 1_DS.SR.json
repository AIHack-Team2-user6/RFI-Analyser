  "justification": "The Offering states the system 'provides a secure and scalable environment to store, manage, and retrieve simulation models, including algorithmic codebases, business rules, and metadata,' directly supporting the requirement. Reference to 'efficient simulation model repository management' reinforces its appropriateness. However, while it claims to facilitate 'portfolio management,' it does not provide explicit detail on configuration management or governance controls, only mentioning compliance via NIST SP 800-53 in Interfaces. Strong coverage, but lacking full specificity.",
