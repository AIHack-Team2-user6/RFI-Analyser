  "justification": "Vendor 3 addresses the requirement by explicitly providing 'secure, tamper-proof recordkeeping and automation through distributed ledger technologies,' supporting 'smart contracts,' and ensuring 'immutable audit trails.' Interfaces include Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, aligning with systems supporting smart contracts. The mention of compliance (GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001, FIPS 140-2) further supports trustworthy interactions. However, while the response is detailed, it lacks explicit examples of integration specifically with digital twin architectures, slightly limiting completeness.",
