  "score": 8,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 explicitly addresses Digital Twin safety management via 'simulation, monitoring, and risk prevention mechanisms' and references 'validation models, alert mechanisms, and restricted operational controls.' It claims to minimize risk of injury and damage, and applies to high-risk industries. Interfaces support safety signal integration and compliance with relevant safety standards (ISO 12100, ISO 13849, IEC 61508). However, while the claims are strong, there is minor lack of specific operational detail or real-world evidence, so a perfect 10 is not justified.",
  "ability": "The ability to operate digital twins without causing unacceptable risk of physical injury or damage to the health of people, either directly, or indirectly as a result of damage to property or to the environment",
