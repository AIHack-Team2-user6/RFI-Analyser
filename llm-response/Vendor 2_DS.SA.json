  "justification": "Vendor 2 explicitly states support for 'tiered storage options (Hot, Cool, and Archive)', allowing organizations to categorize data by 'access frequency and retention duration' with 'long-term historical data retention.' This directly addresses the ability, and regulatory compliance is supported. However, while organization and retrieval are implied, explicit details about retrieval processes are not described, slightly limiting completeness.",
  "ability": "The ability to store, organize and retrieve data  based on how frequently it will be accessed and how long it will be retained.",
