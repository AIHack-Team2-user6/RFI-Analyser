The offering states it 'supports long-term historical data retention for analysis and compliance,' which matches the purpose. Interfaces mention data lifecycle governance and regulatory alignment. However, the response could be clearer on retrieval mechanisms, so a score of 9 is appropriate.",
  "ability": "The ability to store, organize and retrieve data  based on how frequently it will be accessed and how long it will be retained.",
