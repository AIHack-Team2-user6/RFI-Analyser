  "score": 8,
  "justification": "The vendor explicitly describes a workflow engine that 'automates business processes tied to Digital Twin behavior' and enables 'a sequence of actions as a process flow.' Features such as visual and rule-based workflow definition, integration, and escalation paths show fulfillment. Interfaces with BPMN 2.0 and integration with enterprise systems further support the requirement. However, while the response is strong, it does not provide detailed real-world examples or direct experience, which prevents a perfect score.",
