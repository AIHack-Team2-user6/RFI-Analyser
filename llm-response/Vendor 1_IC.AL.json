However, while it addresses display and triggering of alerts/messages, explicit capabilities for managing message queues, triggers, and intervention workflows are not directly mentioned. References such as 'facilitates alerts and notifications,' and 'real-time, bi-directional communication' suggest partial but not complete support.",
