  "score": 7,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 mentions integration with 'Microsoft Teams, Slack, and enterprise service portals' and emphasizes 'conversational UIs,' satisfying most collaboration requirements. However, there is no explicit reference to Yammer or Jabber as required. Support for 'chat-based interfaces' and 'voice interaction' is detailed, but the lack of mention for some platforms keeps it from a perfect score.",
  "ability": "The ability for the digital twin to interface with platforms like Yammer, Jabber, Teams, Slack",
