  "score": 8,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 states an 'interactive graph-based visualization of digital twin hierarchies' with user abilities to 'view, query, and navigate through connected digital entities,' directly matching the requirement for interactive navigation and presentation of relationships. However, user friendliness for business users is not explicitly detailed, and the language is somewhat technical rather than focusing on ease-of-use, preventing a perfect score.",
