  "justification": "Vendor 2 explicitly describes 'interactive graph-based visualization of digital twin hierarchies' through 'Entity Explorer' and 'customizable UI components,' matching the requirement for interactive, user-friendly navigation. However, there is limited detail on how business users engage with or interact with the hierarchies beyond generic terms like 'view, query, and navigate.' The evidence is strong but would benefit from more specific examples of user-friendly interaction.",
