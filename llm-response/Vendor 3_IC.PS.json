  "justification": "The Offering explicitly states 'delivering prescriptive guidance using embedded AI, operational rules, and contextual awareness' and describes suggesting 'optimal next steps' (e.g., prevent a fault, adjust a parameter), directly mapping to the requirement for prescriptive recommendations. However, while strong, minor details about the workflow and full integration with business outcomes are described generally ('to create actions and deliver business outcomes') rather than providing concrete examples or methods, slightly limiting completeness.",
