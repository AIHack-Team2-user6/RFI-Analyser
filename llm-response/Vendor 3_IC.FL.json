{
  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 states 'supports federated learning on Cloud 3, allowing distributed devices and edge systems to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data.' It addresses privacy, data residency, and security (GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2 compliance). It also explicitly supports 'model synchronization,' 'differential privacy,' and 'distributed devices.' However, there is no direct, detailed mention of handling heterogeneous data or explicit 'digital twin' references, justifying a score of 9 rather than 10.",
  "ability": "The ability to train an algorithm across multiple decentralized digital twin edge devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging their data samples.",
  "category": " Intelligence",
  "capability": "Federated Learning"
