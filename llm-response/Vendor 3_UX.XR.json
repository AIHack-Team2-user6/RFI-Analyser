  "justification": "Vendor 3's offering explicitly describes 'immersive XR experiences' for real-time visualization and interaction with digital twins in AR, VR, and MR, addressing immersive, interactive, and contextualized experiences. The interfaces support major XR standards and engines, and compliance with ISO/IEC 27001, GDPR, and NIST SP 800-53 is specified. The ability statement directly references enhancing real-world objects with computer-generated perceptual information. However, while multiple modalities (visual, auditory, haptic) are mentioned, explicit support for auditory/haptic interfaces is not detailed."
