  "justification": "Vendor 3 describes 'immersive XR experiences' enabling 'real-time visualization, collaboration, and simulation within AR, VR, and MR environments,' referencing interaction with physical world models. However, while the offering mentions data overlays, it does not explicitly state enhancements using auditory or haptic information. The interfaces show technical compatibility but do not guarantee interactive sensory augmentation beyond visuals. Evidence for a 'fully' interactive, multisensory augmentation is partial, addressing visual interaction strongly but lacking clarity on auditory/haptic aspects.",
  "ability": "The ability to provide an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information such as visual, auditory, haptic etc.  environment.",
