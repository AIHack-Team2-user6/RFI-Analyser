jsonCopyEdit{"score": 10, "justification": "The response directly addresses key elements: 'centralized model repository', 'define, version, and manage complex asset hierarchies', and 'model governance and versioning workflows.' It explicitly supports metadata tagging, change history, and model validation. Interfaces cover major standards (STEP, AutomationML, OPC UA, REST API), and compliance frameworks (ISO/IEC 27001, NIST SP 800-53). The 'ability' section clearly details storage, management, retrieval of metadata, and comprehensive data definitions, matching the apparent requirement for robust digital twin management."}
