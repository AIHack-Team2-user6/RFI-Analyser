  "score": 8,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 describes a 'powerful orchestration engine' that 'automates the flow of data and processes between Digital Twins, control systems, cloud apps, and analytics platforms' with 'conditional workflows, failure handling, multi-device task routing, and dynamic resource provisioning.' These features clearly support automated management and coordination, as required. The mention of BPMN 2.0 and auditability strengthens evidence. However, while extensive, the answer does not detail specific ease-of-use mechanisms or directly mention configuration automation, leaving slight gaps for a perfect score.",
  "ability": "The ability to coordinate the automated configuration, management, and coordination of  systems, applications, digital twins and services.",
