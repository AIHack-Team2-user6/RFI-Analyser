  "justification": "Vendor 2 describes 'real-time monitoring of assets, systems, and sensors' and 'data streams are visualized in dashboards,' addressing the requirement for presenting continuously updated information. However, there are no explicit statements about interaction with the information or confirmation of zero/low latency. Evidence is strong for real-time visualization but less clear on full interactive capabilities and precise latency measures.",
