{
  "score": 7,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 'offers real-time monitoring' and 'data streams are visualized in dashboards,' which addresses the requirement to present continuously updated information. However, there is no explicit mention of user interactivity with the data (e.g., filtering, drilling down, making real-time decisions within the interface). The response strongly supports real-time presentation but gives limited evidence regarding interactions, hence a score of 7.",
  "ability": "The ability to present and interact with continuously updated information streaming at zero or low latency.",
  "category": " User Experience",
  "capability": "Real-time Monitoring"
