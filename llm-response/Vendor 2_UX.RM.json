  "justification": "Vendor 2 states 'real-time monitoring of assets, systems, and sensors' and 'data streams are visualized in dashboards,' which supports the requirement for continuously updated information. However, there is no explicit reference to 'zero or low latency' or to user 'interaction' with the information. Thus, the evidence is strong for real-time presentation, but limited for interaction and specific latency details.",
