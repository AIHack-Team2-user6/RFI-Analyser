  "justification": "Vendor 2 states 'real-time monitoring of assets, systems, and sensors' and 'data streams are visualized in dashboards,' directly supporting the requirement for 'continuously updated information streaming at zero or low latency.' Interfaces for real-time protocols (MQTT, OPC UA, AMQP, HTTPS) are provided. However, specifics about 'zero or low latency' response times are not quantified, and the level of interactivity described is limited (only 'visualized' is mentioned, not explicitly 'interacted with').",
