  "justification": "The offering cites 'robust security measures, including role-based access control (RBAC) and encryption' and 'compliance with industry standards' to mitigate risks, directly referencing prevention of 'unauthorized access' and risks to 'health, property, or the environment.' However, the response does not specify safety assurances beyond IT security, nor does it detail how operational safety (beyond digital measures) is maintained. Evidence for non-digital risk mitigation is limited.",
  "ability": "The ability to operate digital twins without causing unacceptable risk of physical injury or damage to the health of people, either directly, or indirectly as a result of damage to property or to the environment",
