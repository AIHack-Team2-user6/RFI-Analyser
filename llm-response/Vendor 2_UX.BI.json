  "score": 9,
  "justification": "The response explicitly states 'integrated BI through Mendix Dashboards and MindSphereâ€™s Insight Hub, enabling real-time and historical data analytics,' allowing 'business users to visualize operational metrics, trigger alerts, and export analytics.' Interfaces enable access via standard APIs and export formats. This closely aligns with the ability required. However, while strong, there could be more explicit breakdown on support for 'various personas,' so it's not a perfect 10.",
  "ability": "The ability to analyze stored data (records) to derive insights and actions in a business user focused visual interface",
