  "score": 8,
  "justification": "The offering provides cloud-based remote rendering for Unity, Unreal, and HLA & DIS compliant engines, supporting ‘high-fidelity 3D model visualization,’ ‘cloud computing to stream high-quality, interactive 3D content,’ and ‘real-time, high-resolution 3D rendering’—all directly relevant. Interfaces explicitly mention REST APIs and integration with major engines, plus alignment with security standards (GDPR, ISO, SOC 2). The ability statement is somewhat general (‘immersive virtual worlds and interactive experiences’) but connects to Digital Twins and the digital metaverse. Strong explicit support, but detail on workflow or customizability is limited."
