  "justification": "Vendor 2 explicitly details 'bi-directional communication between control systems, IoT sensors, SCADA, and Cloud 2', and supports 'OPC UA, MQTT, Modbus, and REST APIs', directly addressing integration with OT, IoT, and SCADA as required. The mention of 'real-time ingestion, processing, and analysis' further aligns with the easy data flow aspect. However, while strong overall, there is no explicit reference to Digital Twin systems, which slightly limits completeness.",
