  "score": 8,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 explicitly states support for federated learning 'via Vendor 2 AI Edge, allowing algorithm training across decentralized edge nodes without transmitting raw data,' which aligns with the requirement. The response mentions privacy, regulatory compliance, and support for ONNX and TensorFlow Lite. However, it does not clearly address aspects like model aggregation methods or handling of heterogeneous data beyond framework compatibility, leaving minor gaps.",
  "ability": "The ability to train an algorithm across multiple decentralized digital twin edge devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging their data samples.",
