  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 provides detailed logging—'system events, data access, transactions, and anomalies'—and explicitly supports 'forensic investigation, root-cause analysis, and regulatory audit,' which strongly aligns with the requirement to trace user activities. The offered interfaces—REST APIs, Syslog, Kibana—indicate accessible and integrable logs. Compliance with ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2, and GDPR further supports rigor. However, there is no explicit statement about retention periods or user-specific context granularity, slightly lowering confidence for a perfect score.",
  "ability": "The ability to record events, transactions, access data of users, and transactions to understand and trace the activities occurring in a Digital Twin system.",
