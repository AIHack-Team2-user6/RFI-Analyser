  "justification": "Vendor 2 clearly describes capturing 'system events, data access, transactions, and anomalies' and supporting 'forensic investigation, root-cause analysis, and regulatory audit,' directly mapping to the requirement to 'record events, transactions, access data of users.' Multiple access interfaces (REST APIs, Syslog, Kibana) and compliance standards are mentioned. However, user-specific access recording is implied rather than explicitly detailed, preventing a perfect score.",
