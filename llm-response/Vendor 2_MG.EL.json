  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 explicitly states that 'Logs include system events, data access, transactions, and anomalies,' closely matching the requirement to record events, transactions, and user access data. Forensic and audit support is mentioned, and access is detailed ('REST APIs, Syslog, and Kibana connectors'). Compliance standards are listed. However, absolute traceability to individual user activities within the context of a Digital Twin system is implied but not demonstrated with concrete user-level log examples, so a perfect score is unwarranted.",
  "ability": "The ability to record events, transactions, access data of users, and transactions to understand and trace the activities occurring in a Digital Twin system.",
