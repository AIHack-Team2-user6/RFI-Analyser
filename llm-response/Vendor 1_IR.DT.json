  "justification": "The response explicitly mentions features enabling 'integration and interoperability between multiple Digital Twin applications' (Offering 3) and 'efficient data movement, transformation, and synchronization across various sources' (Offering 1). However, it does not provide specific examples or mechanisms for accessing information from existing Digital Twin instances or detail cross-system integration workflows. The evidence is solid but lacks technical specificity and concrete use cases.",
