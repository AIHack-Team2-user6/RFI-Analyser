  "score": 9,
  "justification": "The response provides strong evidence of supporting integration and interoperability, citing offerings such as 'facilitates the integration of Digital Twin applications' and a 'comprehensive platform for creating and managing digital representations' that enable 'seamless integration.' Interfaces are covered with references to adherence to standards like NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 and FedRAMP for security and compliance. However, details are high-level and do not specify particular protocols, formats, or concrete interoperability mechanisms, which prevents a perfect score."
