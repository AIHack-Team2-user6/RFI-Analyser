  "justification": "Vendor 3 explicitly offers 'complex mathematical analytics such as engineering calculations, fluid dynamics, stress-strain analysis, and energy flow modeling,' directly supporting 'physics-based and other mathematical models' in digital twin analytics. Mention of 'real-time and batch-based analysis' and 'tightly integrated into the digital twin architecture' further matches the requirement. Interface support (Python, MATLAB, REST APIs) strengthens the offering. The only deduction is due to no explicit mention of statistical calculations, only mathematical/physics-based. Thus, almost fully satisfies, but slightly incomplete.",
