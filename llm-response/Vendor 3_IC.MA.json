  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 explicitly states support for 'complex mathematical analytics such as engineering calculations, fluid dynamics, stress-strain analysis, and energy flow modeling,' which directly aligns with the ability to perform mathematical and statistical calculations. The mention of integration 'into the digital twin architecture' addresses use within digital twin analytics. Interface support for Python, MATLAB, and HPC strengthens the case. However, statistical calculations are not expressly referenced, which leaves a minor gap for a perfect score.",
