  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 'provides specialized computational tools...to support complex mathematical analytics' including 'engineering calculations, fluid dynamics, stress-strain analysis, and energy flow modeling', which 'are tightly integrated into the digital twin architecture.' This directly aligns with the requirement to 'perform mathematical and statical calculations to enable physics-based and other mathematical models.' The explicit mention of real-time and batch-based analysis for mission-critical applications further reinforces suitability. Interfaces supporting Python/MATLAB also substantiate usability. No explicit mention of statistical calculations, preventing a perfect score.",
