  "justification": "The Offering states the workbench enables 'complex mathematical analytics and engineering calculations,' which aligns with the ability to perform mathematical/statistical calculations for physics-based models. However, it does not specifically mention 'statistical' calculations, and there is no explicit reference to Digital twin analytics or physics models in analytics context. No examples or quantitative capabilities are listed.",
