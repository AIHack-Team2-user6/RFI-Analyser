  "justification": "The Offering specifies ‘complex mathematical analytics and engineering calculations’ explicitly, which supports the requirement for performing mathematical and physical model computations. However, there is no direct mention of ‘statistical calculations’ or Digital Twin-specific analytics. The description is strong but does not provide exhaustive coverage or examples relating to the full breadth of the requirement.",
