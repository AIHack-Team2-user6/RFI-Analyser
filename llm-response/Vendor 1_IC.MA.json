  "score": 7,
  "justification": "The Offering states it provides a 'robust environment for performing complex mathematical analytics and engineering calculations,' which aligns with the ability to perform mathematical and statistical calculations for physics-based models. However, it does not specifically mention 'statistical' calculations, nor does it directly reference digital twin analytics, making the match strong but not fully comprehensive.",
