  "justification": "Vendor 2 provides 'domain-specific data management via Simcenter... and Mendix Data Hub,' explicitly supporting 'scalable, structured storage and retrieval' of specialized datasets. Reference to 'engineering, simulation, and OT datasets across various domains' demonstrates focused support for handling distinct data types. Adherence to relevant standards and APIs strengthens the evidence. However, the response lacks concrete operational details or metrics illustrating efficiency or data access performance as required by the 'efficiently handle' aspect.",
  "ability": "The ability to efficiently handle, store, and retrieve data based on the distinct characteristics inherent to specific data types.",
