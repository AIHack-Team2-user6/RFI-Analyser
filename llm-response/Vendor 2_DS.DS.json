  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 explicitly offers 'domain-specific data management via Simcenter (for simulation and physics-based data) and Mendix Data Hub,' supporting 'structured storage and retrieval of engineering, simulation, and OT datasets.' They further support interoperability via APIs and industry standards (e.g., ISO 15926, ISA-95/99). The ability section confirms efficiency in handling data 'based on the distinct characteristics inherent to specific data types.' However, there is minimal detail on real-world deployment or specific workflows, so a perfect score is not warranted."
