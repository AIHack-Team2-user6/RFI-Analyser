  "justification": "Vendor 2 demonstrates support for domain-specific data management with 'Simcenter (for simulation and physics-based data)' and 'Mendix Data Hub (for low-code enterprise data orchestration)'. The statement 'scalable, structured storage and retrieval of engineering, simulation, and OT datasets' directly aligns with the ability. However, evidence for 'efficiently handle' and more detail on retrieval mechanisms is somewhat general and lacks explicit examples or quantifiable metrics.",
  "ability": "The ability to efficiently handle, store, and retrieve data based on the distinct characteristics inherent to specific data types.",
