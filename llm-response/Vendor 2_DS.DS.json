  "score": 8,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 explicitly states 'domain-specific data management via Simcenter (for simulation and physics-based data) and Mendix Data Hub (for low-code enterprise data orchestration)' and emphasizes 'scalable, structured storage and retrieval.' Interfaces supporting ISO 15926 and domain-specific APIs further support capability. However, the response does not provide concrete examples or detail on 'efficient' handling beyond mentioning scalability and standard compliance, leaving minor ambiguity on optimization for different data types.",
  "ability": "The ability to efficiently handle, store, and retrieve data based on the distinct characteristics inherent to specific data types.",
