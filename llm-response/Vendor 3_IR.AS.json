  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 describes an 'API gateway service' allowing exposure of services and data to 'internal teams, partners, and third-party systems', directly referencing external, partner, and internal developers. They mention 'secure access' via APIs with rate limiting, authentication, and versioning. The support for OpenAPI, REST, GraphQL, and WebHooks covers standard integration needs. The response, however, does not explicitly address if APIs completely abstract underlying implementation, leaving a minor ambiguity regarding simplification, so a perfect score is withheld.",
