  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 provides 'comprehensive analytics capabilities,' 'customizable dashboards,' support for REST APIs, SQL, OData, and GraphQL, and compliance with security standards. The offering describes visualization, querying, filtering, and statistical tools for deriving operational insights and forecasting trends. The 'Ability' section explicitly details the study, analysis, and presentation of data with the purpose of understanding trends. Minor details (real-time visualization/interoperability) could be elaborated further, preventing a perfect 10."
