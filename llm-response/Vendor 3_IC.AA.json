  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 provides 'customizable dashboards,' data filtering, queries, statistical tools, and visualization capabilities that align closely with the requirement of studying and presenting data through charts, tables, and dashboards. The mention of forecasting trends, filtering by event patterns, and running queries supports advanced analytics. However, there is no explicit mention of tables (only dashboards/visuals), and the claim is broad; thus, it narrowly misses a perfect score.",
  "ability": "The study and presentation of data to create information and knowledge. The ability to analyze data through charts, tables, dashboards, fetch data between dates, and filter data based on various criteria. The analysis of data, typically large sets of business data, using mathematics, statistics, and computer software with an objective to draw conclusions.",
