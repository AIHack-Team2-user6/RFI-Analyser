  "justification": "Vendor 2 offers Teamcenter for 'centralized storage and governance of digital twin models', mentioning 'structured metadata, version control, and traceability', and 'unified model management', which strongly supports storing, managing, and retrieving metadata. However, while they imply 'structured metadata' and 'proper data structures', there is no explicit reference to 'comprehensive data definitions' or 'precise data integrity rules', slightly weakening the evidence. The offering clearly addresses configuration management and model governance, but lacks direct statements on all required metadata details.",
  "ability": "The ability to store, manage and retrieve the meta data that describe the digital twin model. The model can include formal data names, comprehensive data definitions, proper data structures, and precise data integrity rules. ",
