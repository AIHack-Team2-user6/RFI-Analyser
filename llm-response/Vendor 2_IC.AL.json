  "justification": "Vendor 2 provides 'real-time alerting and notification capabilities', including 'role-based notifications, condition-based alerts, and escalation workflows'. Interfaces like WebSockets, MQTT, and secure HTTP push are specified, with compliance to major security standards. The 'ability to display and manage alerts, messages, message queues, triggers, and notifications' is explicitly confirmed. Notification governance and resilient delivery are also addressed. The response is comprehensive, but mildly lacks details about user configurability or direct integration specifics."
