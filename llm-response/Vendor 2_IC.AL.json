  "justification": "Vendor 2 describes 'real-time alerting and notification capabilities,' including 'role-based notifications' and 'condition-based alerts,' which partially align with managing alerts, messages, and notifications. Protocol support (WebSockets, MQTT, HTTP) implies technical compatibility. However, there is no explicit mention of 'displaying and managing alerts, message queues, or triggers,' nor detailed evidence of intervention mechanisms for ongoing processes as required. The response is strong on delivery and compliance but lacks direct confirmation of management and intervention functions.",
