However, there is no explicit mention of managing 'message queues' or 'triggers' beyond condition-based alerts, and direct capabilities regarding 'display' and 'queue management' are not detailed. Interface protocols and compliance give confidence in delivery, but some elements are implied rather than fully specified.",
