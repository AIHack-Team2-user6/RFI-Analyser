  "justification": "Vendor 3 states that Cloud 3 includes 'simulation model management capabilities, allowing users to register, version, and execute algorithmic and rule-based simulations.' It enables model registration and management in a central repository with support for model governance. However, while management of algorithmic codebase, business rules, and metadata is implied, the text does not explicitly mention dedicated metadata handling or detailed retrieval mechanisms, preventing a perfect score.",
