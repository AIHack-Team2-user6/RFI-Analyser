  "score": 8,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 explicitly states 'simulation model management capabilities, allowing users to register, version, and execute algorithmic and rule-based simulations' and references collaborative workflows, which directly address managing and registering models. It also lists FMI, Modelica, and SysML for managing assets and adherence to industry standards. However, while storage and retrieval of the codebase is implied, explicit mention of storing/retrieving the 'algorithmic codebase, business rules and meta data' is missing, preventing a perfect score.",
