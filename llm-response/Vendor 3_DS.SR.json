  "justification": "Vendor 3's Offering explicitly details simulation model management, including registering, versioning, and executing models, and collaborative workflows with model federation and control. Interfaces list support for FMI, Modelica, SysML, and modern APIs, with adherence to key security/compliance standards. The Ability section directly affirms model storage, management, retrieval, and central repository usage for configuration and governance. All elements relevant to central, secure management are addressed, but it does not provide example implementations or usage statistics, so it misses absolute completeness."
