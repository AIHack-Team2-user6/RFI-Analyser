  "score": 7,
  "justification": "The Offering states the creation of 'live digital replicas of physical environments' and features like 'precise spatial tracking', and 'high-fidelity 3D content,' which collectively support immersive and interactive XR simulations. However, while visual and spatial aspects are covered, there is no explicit mention of auditory, haptic, or broader sensory enhancements. Support for interfaces and compliance is clear and strong, but the requirements around multi-sensory (auditory, haptic) enhancement are not fully elaborated.",
  "ability": "The ability to provide an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information such as visual, auditory, haptic etc.  environment.",
