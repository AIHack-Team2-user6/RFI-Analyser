  "score": 9,
  "justification": "The vendorâ€™s offering explicitly addresses immersive and interactive XR experiences by providing live digital twins of physical environments, spatial anchors for precise tracking, and cloud remote rendering for high-fidelity visualizations. Interfaces are well-detailed, supporting industry standards (REST, MQTT, SDKs) and strong compliance (GDPR, ISO, SOC 2). The stated ability confirms enhancement of real-world objects with computer-generated information and user immersion. The only minor gap is the lack of explicit mention of auditory or haptic modalities."
