  "score": 8,
  "justification": "The Offering describes 'live digital replicas of physical environments' and 'interactive simulations,' which addresses the requirement for an interactive, immersive experience. The inclusion of 'holographic content,' 'high-fidelity 3D,' and 'streamed to XR devices' further supports this. However, there is no explicit mention of enhancements beyond visual (such as auditory or haptic), so the support for multimodal sensory augmentation is only implied, not confirmed, lowering the score from a perfect 10.",
  "ability": "The ability to provide an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information such as visual, auditory, haptic etc.  environment.",
