  "score": 7,
  "justification": "The vendor describes enhancements to XR experiences through 'live digital replicas,' 'precise spatial tracking,' and 'high-fidelity 3D content,' directly supporting interactivity and immersion. References to 'interactive simulations,' 'interactive visualizations,' and 'holographic content' strongly suggest visual and spatial augmentation. However, the text only explicitly mentions visual and spatial enhancementsâ€”there are no references to auditory, haptic, or other modalities as listed in the requirement. Therefore, while there is clear support for most immersive features, the lack of explicit multi-sensory detail justifies a score of 7.",
  "ability": "The ability to provide an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information such as visual, auditory, haptic etc.  environment.",
