  "justification": "The response states 'Vendor 2 delivers an integrated Digital Twin Instance Repository,' which 'supports real-time capture and synchronization of asset state data with the digital twin model,' and details the 'ability to store, manage and retrieve digital twin instance data.' This directly addresses the requirement. The inclusion of interface standards (OPC UA, MQTT, REST APIs) and security compliance adds strength. However, more detail on how data retrieval and management occur could further strengthen the response."
