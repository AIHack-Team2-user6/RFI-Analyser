  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 provides strong evidence of immersive XR capabilities by referencing 'simulate, interact with, and collaborate on digital representations,' and enabling 'explore 3D models, simulate system behavior.' Interfaces with key XR standards (OpenXR, Unity, Unreal Engine) and REST APIs support integration. The Ability section details enhancement with 'visual, auditory, haptic' information for an 'improved, immersive, and interactive experience.' Minor lack of concrete end-user examples prevents a perfect score."
