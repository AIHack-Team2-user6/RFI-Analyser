  "justification": "Vendor 3 provides 'high-fidelity immersive visualizations' and 'interactive' experiences using game engines (Unity, Unreal), explicitly mentioning 'complex simulation, training, and collaborative design reviews' and that these are 'synced in real time.' Interface support (Unity, Unreal Engine, WebGL) also matches. However, thereâ€™s no explicit mention of enabling a 'digital metaverse' or detailing user interaction mechanics, preventing a perfect score.",
