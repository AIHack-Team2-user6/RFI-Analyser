  "score": 9,
  "justification": "The response explicitly states the use of 'game engines on Cloud 3' and the ability to render 'complex simulation, training, and collaborative design reviews' interactively using Unity, Unreal, or HLA/DIS-compliant platforms, directly aligning with the ability to create 'immersive virtual worlds and interactive experiences.' The mention of synchronizing real-time data addresses interactivity with digital twins. However, the explanation does not detail the user-side (end-user) interaction mechanisms in the metaverse beyond 'collaborative design reviews,' so a perfect 10 is not justified.",
