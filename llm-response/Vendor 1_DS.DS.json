  "score": 8,
  "justification": "The Offering states it 'provides domain-specific data management by enabling scalable storage and processing of large datasets,' which aligns well with the requirement to handle, store, and retrieve domain-specific data. However, there is no explicit mention of retrieval mechanisms tailored to different data types beyond scalability and analytics capability. The Interfaces section focuses on compliance rather than functionality. Thus, it mostly addresses the requirement but lacks detailed evidence regarding retrieval based on distinct data types.",
  "ability": "The ability to efficiently handle, store, and retrieve data based on the distinct characteristics inherent to specific data types.",
  "category": " Data Services",
  "capability": "Domain Specific Data Management"
