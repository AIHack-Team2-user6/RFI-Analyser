  "score": 9,
  "justification": "The response provides strong evidence, stating that Cloud 1 Data Lake enables scalable storage, processing, and management of domain-specific data, and explicitly mentions compliance with domain-specific interfaces (NIST SP 800-53). The ability section reinforces efficient handling and retrieval based on unique data attributes. However, minor detail on explicit integration processes or user interaction prevents a perfect score."
