  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 fully addresses prescriptive decision-making through 'built-in ML engines and rule-based systems,' using 'sensor data, historical performance, and digital twin simulations.' Interfaces include REST, MQTT, OPC UA, and 'integration with Python ML libraries,' supporting technical compatibility. The ability statement confirms 'prescriptive recommendations' and guidance from analytics, business rules, and workflows. Information is strong and explicit; minor detail is lacking on workflow orchestration depth."
