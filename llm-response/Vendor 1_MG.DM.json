{
  "score": 9,
  "justification": "The response addresses device provisioning ('zero-touch, just-in-time provisioning'), authentication (robust device management capabilities, security and compliance), configuration, maintenance (updates), monitoring, and diagnosis ('collecting, analyzing, and responding to monitoring data'). It references integration with Digital Twins. However, while strong, some functions (e.g., explicit mention of diagnosis or all possible device capabilities) are implied rather than exhaustively detailed. The response is comprehensive but not flawless; minor gaps in explicitness warrant a 9 rather than a perfect score.",
  "ability": "The ability to provision and authenticate, configure, maintain, monitor and diagnose connected IoT devices operating as part of Digital Twin environment",
