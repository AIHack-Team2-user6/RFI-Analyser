  "justification": "The vendor demonstrates comprehensive device management across provisioning ('zero-touch, just-in-time provisioning of millions of devices'), authentication (security and compliance references), configuration, maintenance ('over-the-air updates'), monitoring ('Cloud 1 Monitor'), and diagnostics (monitoring and responding to data). Direct mention of Digital Twins environment is made, with appropriate protocol support (REST, MQTT, DTDL, etc.), but certain aspects such as explicit explanation of authentication mechanisms are only implied rather than detailed, preventing a perfect score.",
