  "justification": "Vendor 2 addresses most elements: 'high-fidelity modeling, multi-physics simulation, and what-if analysis' match imitation and what-if scenarios; 'operator training simulations' corresponds to training operations and maintenance teams. However, there is no explicit mention of using video, audio, or animation as data sources or inputs, only a general reference to modeling and simulation.",
  "ability": "The ability to create approximate imitation of a process or a system using past historical information, physical models, video, audio, and animation, what-if-scenarios.",
