  "score": 7,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 addresses high-fidelity modeling, multi-physics simulation, what-if analysis, and operator training simulations, which aligns with creating imitations and team training as required. However, there is no explicit mention of using video, audio, or animation, and the use of past historical information is implied but not confirmed. Direct references are: 'high-fidelity modeling, multi-physics simulation, and what-if analysis,' and 'operator training simulations.'",
  "ability": "The ability to create approximate imitation of a process or a system using past historical information, physical models, video, audio, and animation, what-if-scenarios.",
