  "score": 8,
  "justification": "Vendor 2's Simcenter offers 'high-fidelity modeling, multi-physics simulation, and what-if analysis of digital twins,' explicitly matching the requirement for process/system imitation and scenario testing. It supports 'performance evaluation, operator training,' covering both predictive and training aspects. Interfaces mention open formats and security, but there is no explicit mention of using 'video, audio, and animation,' nor direct evidence of historical data integration. Thus, while very strong, the answer omits some requested modalities, making a perfect score unjustified.",
  "ability": "The ability to create approximate imitation of a process or a system using past historical information, physical models, video, audio, and animation, what-if-scenarios.",
