  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 'offers extensive OT and IoT integration capabilities using Cloud 3 edge gateways and protocol bridges,' which 'enables real-time data acquisition from industrial assets, SCADA, and sensor networks,' directly supporting 'integration with control systems and IOT devices/sensors.' Interface details—'supports Modbus, OPC UA, BACnet, MQTT, and AMQP'—explicitly address the need for broad integration. However, while strong, there's no mention of specific Digital Twin frameworks or depth of bidirectionality, keeping it from a perfect score.",
