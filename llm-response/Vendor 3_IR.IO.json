  "justification": "Vendor 3 provides 'extensive OT and IoT integration capabilities' and details both protocols ('Modbus, OPC UA, BACnet, MQTT, and AMQP') and architecture ('Cloud 3 edge gateways and protocol bridges') for real-time acquisition from 'industrial assets, SCADA, and sensor networks.' This directly meets the need for integration and data flow between OT, IoT, and Digital Twin systems. However, while comprehensive, there are no concrete deployment examples or quantitative performance metrics, hence not a perfect 10.",
