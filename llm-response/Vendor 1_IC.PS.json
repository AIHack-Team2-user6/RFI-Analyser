  "justification": "The response repeatedly claims to provide 'prescriptive recommendations', e.g., via 'Cloud 1 Advisor', 'integrating data science workflows and machine learning', and 'Well-Architected Framework'. However, there is no explicit mention of the use of business rules, triggering based on pre-determined events, or specific Digital Twin guidance. AI logic is referenced only in general 'machine learning models'. Thus, the offering partially addresses the requirement but lacks clarity on all key aspects.",
  "ability": "The ability to create prescriptive recommendations based on business rules and AI logic to suggest the best next actions to take when a pre-determined event happens. ",
