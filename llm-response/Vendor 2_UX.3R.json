  "justification": "Vendor 2 states it supports 'real-time rendering of large models and point cloud data from LiDAR and scanning systems' and enables 'visual inspection, annotation, and remote collaboration,' which aligns with requirements for interactive and user-friendly 3D visualization. However, while 'user friendly' is implied via collaboration and annotation features, there is no explicit mention of the user interface or usability testing, slightly limiting the evidence.",
