  "justification": "Vendor 2 explicitly claims to support 'real-time rendering of large models and point cloud data from LiDAR and scanning systems,' enabling 'visual inspection, annotation, and remote collaboration.' There is also mention of 'edge rendering for bandwidth optimization,' relevant for large datasets. However, while 'user friendly' interaction is implied by collaboration and annotation, it is not directly described. Thus, the offering strongly addresses but does not perfectly and fully evidence every nuance of the requirement.",
