  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 fully addresses the requirement by supporting 'complex mathematical analytics using simulation tools like Simcenter Amesim and HEEDS for model-based engineering and optimization,' explicitly mentioning physics-based models and 'the ability to perform mathematical and statical calculations.' Support for co-simulation standards (FMI, RESTful APIs, Python SDKs) and key certifications further strengthen compliance. However, the depth of practical application examples is not detailed, preventing a perfect score."
