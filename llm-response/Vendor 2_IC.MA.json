  "justification": "Vendor 2 states support for 'complex mathematical analytics using simulation tools like Simcenter Amesim and HEEDS for model-based engineering and optimization,' which aligns well with the requirement for physics-based and mathematical models in Digital Twin analytics. Explicit mention of 'HPC environments' suggests capability for complex calculations. However, a direct mention of 'statistical' calculations is absent, which slightly limits the breadth of their evidence.",
