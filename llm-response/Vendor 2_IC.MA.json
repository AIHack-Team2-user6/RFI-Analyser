  "justification": "Vendor 2 states support for 'complex mathematical analytics using simulation tools like Simcenter Amesim and HEEDS for model-based engineering and optimization', clearly aligning with the ability to perform mathematical and statistical calculations for physics-based models. However, there is no explicit mention of 'statistical calculations,' and the link to Digital twin analytics, while strongly implied, is not directly stated.",
