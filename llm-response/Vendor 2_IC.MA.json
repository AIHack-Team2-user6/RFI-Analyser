  "justification": "Vendor 2 cites 'complex mathematical analytics using simulation tools like Simcenter Amesim and HEEDS for model-based engineering and optimization,' which aligns directly with performing mathematical calculations for physics-based models. However, while it mentions simulation and optimization, it is somewhat general and does not specifically mention statistical calculations or provide direct examples of analytics usage in digital twins.",
