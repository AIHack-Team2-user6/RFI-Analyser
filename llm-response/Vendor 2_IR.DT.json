  "score": 8,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 states 'seamless integration of Digital Twin applications through Teamcenter and Mendix' with 'bidirectional data movement and synchronization,' which directly addresses interoperability. Interfaces listed (OPC UA, MQTT, REST APIs, ISO/IEC 26550) support standardized integration. However, while strong, the evidence is mostly descriptive and lacks concrete implementation examples or demonstration of integration with existing, heterogeneous digital twins, which prevents a perfect score.",
