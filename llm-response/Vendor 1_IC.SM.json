  "justification": "The Offering describes a 'fully managed environment for engineering design and simulation' and 'secure and efficient user collaboration.' While this implies modeling capabilities, there is no explicit mention of using 'historical information,' 'video, audio, and animation,' or supporting 'what-if-scenarios.' Interfaces and security are described, but the connection to training or digital twins is not directly addressed, making evidence only partially aligned with the requirement.",
  "ability": "The ability to create approximate imitation of a process or a system using past historical information, physical models, video, audio, and animation, what-if-scenarios.",
