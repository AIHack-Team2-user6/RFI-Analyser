  "justification": "The vendor provides a 'fully managed environment for engineering design and simulation' with 'secure and efficient user collaboration' and support for 'workload-specific virtual machines, high-performance storage, and network configurations.' The ability section details creating digital twins using historical data, physical models, video, audio, animation, and what-if scenarios, explicitly addressing simulation purposes. It also mentions training via simulated digital twins. All elements are directly stated and specific, but some interface details (e.g., API support) could be more explicit."
