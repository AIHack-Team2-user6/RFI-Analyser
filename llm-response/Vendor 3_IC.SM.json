  "justification": "Vendor 3 states their environment enables 'creation of dynamic, physics-based models to imitate the behavior of real-world systems' and 'validate digital twin behavior before deployment', matching part of the requirement. They also mention 'train maintenance or operational staff'. However, there is no explicit mention of using 'past historical information', 'video, audio, and animation', or 'what-if-scenarios', making the response incomplete.",
