  "score": 6,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 addresses creation of 'dynamic, physics-based models,' 'imitate the behavior of real-world systems,' and using simulations for 'training maintenance or operational staff,' which aligns with key aspects of the requirement. However, there is no explicit mention of using 'past historical information,' nor is there reference to integrating 'video, audio, and animation.' Therefore, the response partially meets the requirement with limited direct evidence regarding data types and media.",
  "ability": "The ability to create approximate imitation of a process or a system using past historical information, physical models, video, audio, and animation, what-if-scenarios.",
