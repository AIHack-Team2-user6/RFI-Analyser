  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 provides explicit support for 'point tracking, digital twin interaction badges, achievement levels, and engagement metrics,' directly addressing core gamification elements. The use of Mendix and MindSphere for implementation is stated, and technical interfaces (OAuth2, REST APIs, Mendix SDKs) are included. Compliance with major standards is also noted. However, competition mechanisms are mentioned only indirectly as 'engagement metrics,' rather than explicitly; otherwise, the response is comprehensive."
