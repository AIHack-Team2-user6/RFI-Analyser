{
  "score": 9,
  "justification": "The vendor explicitly mentions 'rich visualization tools' for 'explor[ing] Digital Twin hierarchies, relationships, and dependencies using interactive graphs and 3D interfaces,' clearly supporting the requirement for interactive, user-friendly navigation of complex hierarchies. The mention of sectors demonstrates applicability. The use of terms like 'explore,' 'navigate,' and 'interactive graphs' aligns with the requirement for business-user accessibility, but there is slight ambiguity regarding the depth of user friendliness, justifying a 9 rather than a perfect 10.",
  "ability": "The ability to present Digital Twin entities and their hierarchical or graph-based relationships in an interactive way",
  "category": " User Experience",
  "capability": "Entity Relationship Visualization"
