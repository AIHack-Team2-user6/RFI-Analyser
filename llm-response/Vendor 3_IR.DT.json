  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 provides 'a robust integration framework' through Cloud 3, allowing for 'seamless communication between multiple Digital Twin applications and platforms,' and 'access and correlate information across different twin instances in real-time.' Interfaces list major relevant protocols (OPC UA, MQTT, REST), and security standards are detailed. This directly addresses interoperability and integration as required. However, the response does not provide explicit coverage of legacy/non-standard twins, and little detail is given about onboarding or compatibility limitations, preventing a perfect score.",
