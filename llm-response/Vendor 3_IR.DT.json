  "score": 8,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 states that they provide a 'robust integration framework' enabling 'seamless communication between multiple Digital Twin applications and platforms,' with 'real-time' access and correlation. Explicit mention of 'integration' and 'interoperability' across instances supports the requirement. The interfaces listed (OPC UA, MQTT, REST, IEC 61499), plus compliance/security, reinforce technical ability. However, while strong, there are minimal concrete examples or implementation specifics, preventing a perfect score.",
