  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 3's Offering describes 'seamless communication between multiple Digital Twin applications,' 'access and correlate information across different twin instances in real-time,' and 'supports end-to-end data transformation, orchestration, and contextual synchronization,' directly addressing interoperable integration. Interfaces list relevant standards (OPC UA, MQTT, REST) and security protocols. The response is comprehensive and strongly aligned with the requirement, but lacks minor implementation detail or real-world examples, preventing a perfect score.",
