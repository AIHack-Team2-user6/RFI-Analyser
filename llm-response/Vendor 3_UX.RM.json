  "justification": "Vendor 3 states 'real-time monitoring', 'minimal latency', and 'real-time data streams...visualized in dashboards', directly addressing the need for continuous, low-latency information for real-time decisions. However, while 'minimal latency' is claimed and interfaces are robust, there is no explicit definition of latency performance or demonstration of true zero or sub-second latency. Interaction capabilities with streaming data are not detailed.",
