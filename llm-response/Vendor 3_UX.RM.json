{
  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 claims 'real-time monitoring,' 'observe asset behavior...with minimal latency,' and 'real-time data streams are visualized,' directly addressing low-latency streaming and presentation. Supported interfaces (MQTT, WebSockets) and standards bolster reliability. However, while 'visualized in dashboards' and 'event-driven workflows' imply interactivity, there is no explicit mention of user interaction with streaming data, preventing a perfect score.",
  "ability": "The ability to present and interact with continuously updated information streaming at zero or low latency.",
