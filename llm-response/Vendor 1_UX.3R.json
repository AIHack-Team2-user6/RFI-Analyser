  "justification": "The Offering mentions 'high-fidelity 3D rendering' and 'real-time' streaming, but does not specifically state support for rendering point cloud data sets from LiDAR or other scanning technologies. Interfaces are described generally, with no explicit mention of tools for handling point cloud data. Evidence partially aligns with the requirement, but explicit support for point cloud LiDAR data is missing.",
