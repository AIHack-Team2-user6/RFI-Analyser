  "justification": "Vendor states 'high-fidelity 3D rendering by leveraging cloud computing' but does not explicitly mention support for point cloud datasets, LiDAR, or specific scanning technologies. The offering references rendering complex models in real time, which may partially address the requirement, but lacks explicit confirmation or user-friendly interaction with large point cloud/3D datasets as required.",
