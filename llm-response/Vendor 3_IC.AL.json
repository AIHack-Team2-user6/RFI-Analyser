  "justification": "Vendor 3 details 'advanced alerting and real-time notification services,' allows routing to various channels, and supports tailored notifications. However, while it references monitoring, escalation, and integration methods (Webhooks, REST APIs, MQTT), it does not specifically mention the ability to 'display and manage alerts, messages, message queues, triggers,' or provide interface details for the management (not just routing) of these elements. The response is robust for notification and escalation but less specific for comprehensive management and queue handling as required.",
