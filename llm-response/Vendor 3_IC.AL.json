  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 3 offers 'advanced alerting and real-time notification services' with routing options (SMS, email, messaging platforms, ticketing systems) and can 'tailor notifications by severity, asset type, location, or operational context.' Interfaces include 'Webhooks, REST APIs, MQTT,' and integration abilities. 'The ability to display and manage alerts, messages, message queues, triggers, and notifications' is explicitly stated. The response fully meets requirements but lacks explicit evidence of user interface granularity."
