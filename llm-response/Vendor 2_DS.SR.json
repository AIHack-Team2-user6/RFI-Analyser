  "score": 9,
  "justification": "Vendor 2 describes a 'centralized Simulation Model Repository' for managing 'algorithmic models, business rules, test cases, and simulation metadata,' explicitly supporting 'standardize and govern simulation assets.' The mention of Teamcenter for 'versioning, governance, and traceability' aligns with configuration management and model governance. However, while 'retrieve' is implied, explicit retrieval mechanisms are not detailed, preventing a perfect score.",
  "ability": "The ability to store, manage and retrieve the algorithmic codebase, business rules and meta data that describe a simulation model.",
