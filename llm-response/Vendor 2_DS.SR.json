  "justification": "Vendor 2 clearly details the provision of a 'centralized Simulation Model Repository', capability to manage 'algorithmic models, business rules, test cases, and simulation metadata', and support for 'model versioning, governance, and traceability.' These directly map to the ability to store, manage, and retrieve models and metadata. Reference to open standards (FMI, JT) and integration further solidifies the response, though exact retrieval workflows are not deeply detailed.",
