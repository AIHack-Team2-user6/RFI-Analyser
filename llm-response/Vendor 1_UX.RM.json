{
  "score": 9,
  "justification": "The Offering explicitly describes real-time monitoring, capturing, and analysis of telemetry and data streams ('real-time monitoring by capturing and analyzing telemetry data,' 'processing and analyzing data streams,' 'instant detection'), directly supporting continuous, low-latency information. Interfaces detail support for relevant protocols and compliance standards, but lack explicit reference to user-facing presentation or interactive capabilities. The evidence is strong for real-time data delivery and analysis, but is slightly weakened by the omission of interactive features, justifying a score of 9.",
  "ability": "The ability to present and interact with continuously updated information streaming at zero or low latency.",
  "category": " User Experience",
  "capability": "Real-time Monitoring"
