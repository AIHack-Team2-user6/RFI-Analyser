  "justification": "The Offering descriptions emphasize 'real-time monitoring,' 'immediate insights and alerts,' and 'instant detection of patterns and anomalies,' directly supporting low-latency, continuously updated information for consequential decisions. Interfaces highlight protocol and standard support but do not explicitly mention latency metrics. No explicit evidence of user interaction or specific latency guarantees is given, though the solutions imply real-time capabilities.",
  "ability": "The ability to present and interact with continuously updated information streaming at zero or low latency.",
