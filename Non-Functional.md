To score all submissions based on non-functional requirements (NFRs), we need to evaluate each submission against a set of predefined criteria. Non-functional requirements typically include aspects such as performance, reliability, scalability, usability, maintainability, security, compatibility, and others based on the specific application or system being developed.

Hereâ€™s a process to follow:

---

### **Step 1: Define Criteria and Weightage**
Identify the specific NFRs relevant to your project and assign weightage to each based on importance. For example:

| **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**     | **Weightage (%)** |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Performance                                 | 20%               |
| Reliability                                 | 15%               |
| Scalability                                 | 15%               |
| Usability                                   | 10%               |
| Maintainability                             | 15%               |
| Security                                    | 15%               |
| Compatibility                               | 10%               |

### **Step 2: Define the Scoring Scale**
Create a scoring scale (e.g., 1 to 5) for evaluating each criterion:
- **1:** Poor
- **2:** Below Average
- **3:** Average
- **4:** Good
- **5:** Excellent

---

### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Submission**
Evaluate each submission by scoring it on every NFR criterion. For example:

| **Submission** | **Performance** | **Reliability** | **Scalability** | **Usability** | **Maintainability** | **Security** | **Compatibility** |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|----------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| Submission A   | 4                | 3                | 5                | 3              | 4                    | 4            | 2                  |
| Submission B   | 5                | 5                | 4                | 4              | 3                    | 5            | 4                  |
| Submission C   | 3                | 2                | 3                | 2              | 5                    | 3            | 3                  |

### **Step 4: Calculate Weighted Scores**
Multiply the scores by their corresponding weightages for each criterion, then sum them to calculate the overall score for each submission.

For example:
#### Submission A Calculation:
1. **Performance**: 4 * 20% = 0.8  
2. **Reliability**: 3 * 15% = 0.45  
3. **Scalability**: 5 * 15% = 0.75  
4. **Usability**: 3 * 10% = 0.3  
5. **Maintainability**: 4 * 15% = 0.6  
6. **Security**: 4 * 15% = 0.6  
7. **Compatibility**: 2 * 10% = 0.2  

**Total Score for Submission A** = 0.8 + 0.45 + 0.75 + 0.3 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.2 = **3.7**

#### Submission B Calculation:
1. **Performance**: 5 * 20% = 1.0  
2. **Reliability**: 5 * 15% = 0.75  
3. **Scalability**: 4 * 15% = 0.6  
4. **Usability**: 4 * 10% = 0.4  
5. **Maintainability**: 3 * 15% = 0.45  
6. **Security**: 5 * 15% = 0.75  
7. **Compatibility**: 4 * 10% = 0.4  

**Total Score for Submission B** = 1.0 + 0.75 + 0.6 + 0.4 + 0.45 + 0.75 + 0.4 = **4.35**

#### Submission C Calculation:
1. **Performance**: 3 * 20% = 0.6  
2. **Reliability**: 2 * 15% = 0.3  
3. **Scalability**: 3 * 15% = 0.45  
4. **Usability**: 2 * 10% = 0.2  
5. **Maintainability**: 5 * 15% = 0.75  
6. **Security**: 3 * 15% = 0.45  
7. **Compatibility**: 3 * 10% = 0.3  

**Total Score for Submission C** = 0.6 + 0.3 + 0.45 + 0.2 + 0.75 + 0.45 + 0.3 = **3.05**

---

### **Step 5: Rank Submissions**
Rank all submissions by their total weighted scores:

| **Submission** | **Total Weighted Score** | **Rank** |
|----------------|---------------------------|----------|
| Submission B   | 4.35                      | 1        |
| Submission A   | 3.7                       | 2        |
| Submission C   | 3.05                      | 3        |

---

### **Step 6: Provide Feedback**
Share detailed feedback for each submission based on how they performed in individual NFR criteria. This helps participants understand their strengths and areas for improvement.
