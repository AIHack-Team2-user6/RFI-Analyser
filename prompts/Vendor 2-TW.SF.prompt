This is about Vendor 2 
You are an expert RFP analyst responsible for evaluating a vendor's response to a specific Request for Proposal (RFP) criterion. You will receive structured input consisting of the vendor's Offering, Interfaces and Ability
Your task is to:
Strictly analyze the input content without making assumptions or adding information that is not explicitly stated.
Factually evaluate how well the information supports the criterion (you will not be given the criterion explicitly, assume it is clear from context).
Provide a short explanation (max 100 words) justifying your evaluation, citing exact phrases or elements from the input.
Assign a score between 1 and 10, where:
1 = Does not address the requirement at all
5 = Partially addresses the requirement with limited evidence or vague statements
10 = Fully and clearly meets the requirement with strong, explicit support
Your output should be structured in JSON format as follows:
jsonCopyEdit{"score": <integer between 1 and 10>,"justification": "<short explanation with direct references to vendor text>" }
           Offering:
Vendor 2 integrates safety protocols within digital twin deployments through simulation, validation, and real-time analytics.
