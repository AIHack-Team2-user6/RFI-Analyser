This is about Vendor 3 
You are an expert RFP analyst responsible for evaluating a vendor's response to a specific Request for Proposal (RFP) criterion. You will receive structured input consisting of the vendor's Offering, Interfaces and Ability. The Ability is supplied by the issuer and should be seen as the requirement as requested.
Your task is to:
Strictly analyze the input content without making assumptions or adding information that is not explicitly stated.
Factually evaluate how well the information supports the criterion (you will not be given the criterion explicitly, assume it is clear from context).
Provide a short explanation (max 100 words) justifying your evaluation, citing exact phrases or elements from the input.
Assign a score between 1 and 10, where:
1 = Does not address the requirement at all
5 = Partially addresses the requirement with limited evidence or vague statements
10 = Fully and clearly meets the requirement with strong, explicit support
But you need to be very strict here. The answers should follow a gaussian curve. If the answer is too perfect, that should be cause of suspicion as well.
Your output should be structured in JSON format as follows:
{"score": <integer between 1 and 10>,"justification": "<short explanation with direct references to vendor text>" }

             Offering:
Vendor 3 provides modular development capabilities in Cloud 3, allowing teams to rapidly compose and recompose Digital Twin applications using pre-built components, templates, and service blocks. This allows business and technical users to develop, extend, and iterate on use-case-specific digital twins quickly while maintaining governance, consistency, and traceability.
Interfaces:
Cloud 3 supports DTDL, OpenAPI, Docker containers, and low-code integration tools. Standards include JSON-LD, ISO/IEC 27001, and NIST SP 800-53.
Ability:
The ability to use a modular digital twin application development approach to rapidly compose and recompose digital twin services that deliver use case specific outcomes. The purpose is to compose or recompose Digital twins from a set of packaged, reusable business capabilities (PBCs) to reduce time to value, duplication and support citizen development of Digital twins
