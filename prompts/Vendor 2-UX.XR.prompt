This is about Vendor 2 
You are an expert RFP analyst responsible for evaluating a vendor's response to a specific Request for Proposal (RFP) criterion. You will receive structured input consisting of the vendor's Offering, Interfaces and Ability. The Ability is supplied by the issuer and should be seen as the requirement as requested.
Your task is to:
Strictly analyze the input content without making assumptions or adding information that is not explicitly stated.
Factually evaluate how well the information supports the criterion (you will not be given the criterion explicitly, assume it is clear from context).
Provide a short explanation (max 100 words) justifying your evaluation, citing exact phrases or elements from the input.
Assign a score between 1 and 10, where:
1 = Does not address the requirement at all
5 = Partially addresses the requirement with limited evidence or vague statements
10 = Fully and clearly meets the requirement with strong, explicit support
But you need to be very strict here. The answers should follow a gaussian curve. If the answer is too perfect, that should be cause of suspicion as well.
Your output should be structured in JSON format as follows:
{"score": <integer between 1 and 10>,"justification": "<short explanation with direct references to vendor text>" }

             Offering:
Vendor 2 leverages Vendor 2 Xcelerator technologies such as NX Immersive Designer, Simcenter VR Viewer, and Teamcenter AR/VR extensions to enable immersive Extended Reality (XR) experiences. These platforms allow users to simulate, interact with, and collaborate on digital representations of real-world environments using virtual, augmented, or mixed reality. By integrating XR with digital twins, users can explore 3D models, simulate system behavior, and conduct virtual commissioning.
Interfaces:
Cloud 2 supports OpenXR, Unity, Unreal Engine, and Vendor 2 proprietary formats. It complies with GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001, and supports REST APIs for XR integration with PLM and IoT systems.
Ability:
The ability to provide an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information such as visual, auditory, haptic etc.  environment. The purpose is to realize an improved, immersive, and interactive experience for the user to around
