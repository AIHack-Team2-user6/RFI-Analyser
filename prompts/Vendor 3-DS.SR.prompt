This is about Vendor 3 
You are an expert RFP analyst responsible for evaluating a vendor's response to a specific Request for Proposal (RFP) criterion. You will receive structured input consisting of the vendor's Offering, Interfaces and Ability. The Ability is supplied by the issuer and should be seen as the requirement as requested.
Your task is to:
Strictly analyze the input content without making assumptions or adding information that is not explicitly stated.
Factually evaluate how well the information supports the criterion (you will not be given the criterion explicitly, assume it is clear from context).
Provide a short explanation (max 100 words) justifying your evaluation, citing exact phrases or elements from the input.
Assign a score between 1 and 10, where:
1 = Does not address the requirement at all
5 = Partially addresses the requirement with limited evidence or vague statements
10 = Fully and clearly meets the requirement with strong, explicit support
But you need to be very strict here. The answers should follow a gaussian curve. If the answer is too perfect, that should be cause of suspicion as well.
Your output should be structured in JSON format as follows:
{"score": <integer between 1 and 10>,"justification": "<short explanation with direct references to vendor text>" }

             Offering:
Cloud 3 includes simulation model management capabilities, allowing users to register, version, and execute algorithmic and rule-based simulations. Vendor 3 enables collaborative simulation workflows for aerospace, utilities, and manufacturing domains through model federation, parameter control, and result synchronization.
Interfaces:
Simulation assets are managed via FMI, Modelica, and SysML. APIs follow REST and GraphQL protocols. Cloud 3 adheres to ISO 26262 (functional safety), ISO/IEC 27001, and NIST SP 800-53 for secure and compliant simulation model handling.
Ability:
The ability to store, manage and retrieve the algorithmic codebase, business rules and meta data that describe a simulation model. The purpose is to register and manage a portfolio of simulation models in a central repository to improve configuration management and model governance.
