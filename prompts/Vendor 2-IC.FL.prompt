This is about Vendor 2 
You are an expert RFP analyst responsible for evaluating a vendor's response to a specific Request for Proposal (RFP) criterion. You will receive structured input consisting of the vendor's Offering, Interfaces and Ability. The Ability is supplied by the issuer and should be seen as the requirement as requested.
Your task is to:
Strictly analyze the input content without making assumptions or adding information that is not explicitly stated.
Factually evaluate how well the information supports the criterion (you will not be given the criterion explicitly, assume it is clear from context).
Provide a short explanation (max 100 words) justifying your evaluation, citing exact phrases or elements from the input.
Assign a score between 1 and 10, where:
1 = Does not address the requirement at all
5 = Partially addresses the requirement with limited evidence or vague statements
10 = Fully and clearly meets the requirement with strong, explicit support
But you need to be very strict here. The answers should follow a gaussian curve. If the answer is too perfect, that should be cause of suspicion as well.
Your output should be structured in JSON format as follows:
{"score": <integer between 1 and 10>,"justification": "<short explanation with direct references to vendor text>" }

             Offering:
Cloud 2 â€“ Vendor 2 AI Edge + Industrial Edge Platform:
Vendor 2 supports federated learning via Vendor 2 AI Edge, allowing algorithm training across decentralized edge nodes without transmitting raw data. This preserves data sovereignty, enhances privacy, and supports regulatory compliance.
Interfaces:
Cloud 2 complies with GDPR and ISO standards. Supports RESTful interfaces and edge container orchestration, leveraging frameworks like ONNX and TensorFlow Lite.
Ability:
The ability to train an algorithm across multiple decentralized digital twin edge devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging their data samples. The purpose is to enable multiple actors to build a common, robust machine learning model without sharing data, thus addressing critical issues such as data privacy, data security, data access rights and access to heterogeneous data.
