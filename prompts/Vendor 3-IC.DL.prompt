This is about Vendor 3 
You are an expert RFP analyst responsible for evaluating a vendor's response to a specific Request for Proposal (RFP) criterion. You will receive structured input consisting of the vendor's Offering, Interfaces and Ability
Your task is to:
Strictly analyze the input content without making assumptions or adding information that is not explicitly stated.
Factually evaluate how well the information supports the criterion (you will not be given the criterion explicitly, assume it is clear from context).
Provide a short explanation (max 100 words) justifying your evaluation, citing exact phrases or elements from the input.
Assign a score between 1 and 10, where:
1 = Does not address the requirement at all
5 = Partially addresses the requirement with limited evidence or vague statements
10 = Fully and clearly meets the requirement with strong, explicit support
Your output should be structured in JSON format as follows:
jsonCopyEdit{"score": <integer between 1 and 10>,"justification": "<short explanation with direct references to vendor text>" }
           Offering:
Vendor 3 enables secure, tamper-proof recordkeeping and automation through distributed ledger technologies in Cloud 3. This includes support for smart contracts, which allow Digital Twins to execute trusted transactions automatically based on predefined conditions. Itâ€™s particularly beneficial for industrial ecosystems that require immutable audit trails and autonomous machine-to-machine interactions, such as supply chain, energy trading, and predictive service contracts.
Interfaces:
Cloud 3 supports Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, REST APIs, and JSON-RPC. Compliance includes GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001, and FIPS 140-2 for secure ledger operations and smart contract deployment.
Ability:
The ability to use distributed ledgers for digital twin applications that require immutable data for digital twin instances, transactions and automation (smart contracts) The purpose is to enable Digital twins to interact in an automated, trustworthy, and responsible manner with systems that support smart contracts and provide a full, immutable transaction record.
