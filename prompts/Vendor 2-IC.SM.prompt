This is about Vendor 2 
You are an expert RFP analyst responsible for evaluating a vendor's response to a specific Request for Proposal (RFP) criterion. You will receive structured input consisting of the vendor's Offering, Interfaces and Ability. The Ability is supplied by the issuer and should be seen as the requirement as requested.
Your task is to:
Strictly analyze the input content without making assumptions or adding information that is not explicitly stated.
Factually evaluate how well the information supports the criterion (you will not be given the criterion explicitly, assume it is clear from context).
Provide a short explanation (max 100 words) justifying your evaluation, citing exact phrases or elements from the input.
Assign a score between 1 and 10, where:
1 = Does not address the requirement at all
5 = Partially addresses the requirement with limited evidence or vague statements
10 = Fully and clearly meets the requirement with strong, explicit support
But you need to be very strict here. The answers should follow a gaussian curve. If the answer is too perfect, that should be cause of suspicion as well.
Your output should be structured in JSON format as follows:
{"score": <integer between 1 and 10>,"justification": "<short explanation with direct references to vendor text>" }

             Offering:
Cloud 2 â€“ Simcenter:
Vendor 2 enables simulation through Simcenter, providing high-fidelity modeling, multi-physics simulation, and what-if analysis of digital twins. It supports predictive maintenance, performance evaluation, and operator training simulations.
Interfaces:
Simcenter supports open formats (FMI, JT), integrates with PLM systems like Teamcenter, and complies with NIST SP 800-53, GDPR, and ISO 27001 for simulation security and data management.
Ability:
The ability to create approximate imitation of a process or a system using past historical information, physical models, video, audio, and animation, what-if-scenarios. The purpose is to imitate the behavior of a physical system in the digital twin before applying to the physical world. Training operations and maintenance teams on simulated digital twins is another purpose of simulation
