To create a score for all submissions based on the benefits they provide, I will outline a scoring framework that can be consistently applied across all submissions. Submissions will be assessed using weighted criteria that focus on measurable benefits. These criteria can include categories like *Impact*, *Feasibility*, *Scalability*, and *Alignment with Goals*. Here's an example structure:

---

### **Scoring Framework**
Each submission is scored out of 10 for four criteria, and a total score is calculated:

1. **Impact (0–10):**  
   How significant are the benefits of this submission? Does it create meaningful change (e.g., improvements in productivity, user experience, cost savings, social benefits)?  

   - 0–3: Minimal benefit  
   - 4–6: Moderate benefit  
   - 7–10: High benefit

2. **Feasibility (0–10):**  
   How easy is it to implement this submission based on resources, cost, and technology?  

   - 0–3: Very challenging or impractical  
   - 4–6: Some challenges but manageable  
   - 7–10: Clear path to implementation

3. **Scalability (0–10):**  
   Can this submission scale to benefit a larger audience or future use-cases?  

   - 0–3: Very limited scalability  
   - 4–6: Can scale moderately or within a niche  
   - 7–10: Easy to scale widely   

4. **Alignment with Goals (0–10):**  
   Does this submission align with the overall mission, vision, or stated objectives of the organization/project?  

   - 0–3: Weak alignment  
   - 4–6: Moderate alignment  
   - 7–10: Strong alignment

### **Example Calculation**

**Submission 1**  
- Impact: 8  
- Feasibility: 6  
- Scalability: 7  
- Alignment with Goals: 9  
**Total Score:** *(8 + 6 + 7 + 9)* = **30/40**

**Submission 2**  
- Impact: 5  
- Feasibility: 8  
- Scalability: 9  
- Alignment with Goals: 6  
**Total Score:** *(5 + 8 + 9 + 6)* = **28/40**

### **Next Steps**
1. Apply these criteria to all relevant submissions and calculate scores.  
2. Rank submissions based on total scores to identify the ones providing the most benefits.  
3. Use results to focus on high-scoring submissions that can maximize organizational impact.

Feel free to customize the weighting or add/remove criteria based on your specific context!
